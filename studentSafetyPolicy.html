    <div class="col-10 center">
        As we work to accomplish our mission of providing high quality coding education to under-represented
        communities, students safety must always remain our highest priority. In order to protect students and the
        teachers interacting with them, this document establishes the following:
        <ol>
            <li>Guidelines for OpenBrackets teachers</li>
            <li>A training policy for OpenBrackets teachers</li>
            <li>Steps that will be taken in response to a student safety incident</li>
        </ol>

        <br>

        <h2>1. Guideline for Teachers</h2>
        <br>
        <h3 class="h4">1 (a) Rules for teachers during teaching session</h3>
        <div>
            OpenBrackets teachers and teaching assistants shall follow these rules when interacting with students:
            <ul>
                <li>OpenBrackets staff, volunteers, and board members will comply with the Student Information Policy,
                    including regarding storage of student information and recording of photos.
                </li>
                <li>Teachers shall meet with students in-person or remotely only through OpenBrackets sponsored events
                    and classes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All interactions will take place through official OpenBrackets communication channels such that the
                    interaction is accessible to other students, OpenBrackets teachers, staff, and/or board members.
                    <ul>
                        <li>For example, all video conferencing, such as Zoom, shall take place in the official
                            OpenBrackets video-conference meeting that is designated for the event.
                        </li>
                        <li>For example, all email communication will copy (CC) email to the official OpenBrackets email
                            account, to which multiple people have access.
                        </li>
                        <li>For example, communication on Discord must take place where other teachers and staff have
                            full access to the conversation. Private DMs are not permitted.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Barring a technical emergency, teachers shall have their cameras turned on when interacting with
                    students.
                </li>
                <li>Dress Code: Teachers shall dress appropriately when interacting with students.</li>
                <li>If teachers need to take a break, they should first notify the other teacher(s), then turn off their
                    camera and microphone.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h3 class="h4">1 (b) Rules for teachers outside of teaching sessions</h3>
        <div>
            OpenBrackets teachers and teaching assistants must also follow these rules outside of a class session.
            <ul>
                <li>Teachers shall not correspond with a student privately through their phone calls, texts, or
                    non-OpenBrackets social media accounts for any reason. All email communication with students must be
                    using or copying emails to the official OpenBrackets email address - <a
                            href="mailto:openbracketscoding@gmail.com">openbracketscoding@gmail.com</a>. All inbound
                    student emails to staff or teacher personal email must be forwarded to the official OpenBrackets
                    email address.
                </li>
                <li>Teachers shall not fraternize with students.</li>
            </ul>
            Exceptions to these rules can be made under certain conditions, such as when a teacher and a student has an
            existing familial relationship. In such cases, the teacher must notify the OpenBrackets board prior to the
            student’s first class session. However, exceptions to these rules must remain <i>exceptional</i>.
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>2. Training for Teachers</h2>
        <br>
        <div>
            New OpenBrackets teachers and teaching assistants are required to read this document before they participate
            in a class session. In addition all teachers and teaching assistants must review this document at least once
            every subsequent year.
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>3. Incident Response and Remediation</h2>
        <br>
        <h3 class="h4">3 (a) Immediate Response</h3>
        <div>
            If an incident is reported regarding a student’s safety, the following actions will be taken:

                <li>If the incident is serious enough, an emergency Board meeting shall be held as soon as possible.

                </li>
                <li>Teachers who are suspected or accused of inappropriate behavior will immediately cease to
                    participate in class sessions and other OpenBrackets functions pending investigation.
                </li>
                <li>If the incident is serious enough, such as an allegation of abuse, the police or relevant
                    authorities will be immediately notified.

                    or in a role where they interact with minors, OpenBrackets will notify the offenders’ employers of
