    <h4>Our Inspiration & Mission:</h4>

    <p> With the recent attention towards the Black Lives Matter movement in May, we at OpenBrackets wanted to directly contribute to change we could make, locally. After hearing one of our founders, Nan, speak about bringing STEM support to kids who do not have access to it at home, OpenBrackets was born. We are a group of members of the Palo Alto community, representing different ages and backgrounds. At OpenBrackets, we want to help bridge the digital divide. Through our course offerings, we encourage kids all over the Bay to consider tech as a career.</p>
