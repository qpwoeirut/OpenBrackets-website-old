                            has taken both AP and IB Computer Science. Within CS, he is most interested in
                            Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning, especially when applied to music and the
                            arts. This focus recently led Aimon to complete studies into the mathematics behind
                            Neural Networks as well as the application of Generative Adversarial Networks to
                            music generation. Prior to joining OpenBrackets, Aimon organized a Covid-relief meal
                            service for elderly and immunocompromised members in his community, through which he
                            cooked and donated weekly world cuisines. In his free time, Aimon enjoys playing and
                            listening to music, tossing a disc, and reading.
