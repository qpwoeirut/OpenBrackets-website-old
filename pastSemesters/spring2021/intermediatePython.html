    <p>
        The Intermediate Python Game Building course is for students who have some experience with programming in
        Python.
        <b>It is highly recommended that students take the <a

            Building</a>
            class before this one.</b> In order to
        be able to complete the course, students will need an internet connection, a device capable of running Zoom, and
        a computer that can access <a href="https://repl.it/" target="_blank">https://repl.it/</a>.

            <p>Week 1 Day 1 | <a

                    target="_blank">Slides</a></p>
            <p>To refresh the skills learned in the Intro to Python class, students will review and practice each topic.
                The first day of the review will cover printing, libraries, variables, input, types, and conditionals.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h5 class="mt-0">Lesson 2: Intro to Python Review Part 2</h5>

                    target="_blank">Slides</a></p>
            <p>This will be the second part of the Intro to Python review. It will cover the remaining topics, including
                loops, functions, lists, 2D lists, and dictionaries.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h5 class="mt-0">Lesson 3: Graphics</h5>
            <p>Week 2 Day 1 | <a
                    href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fxQe-OhfXlKWFKfAeVz1-aXHVBsc8HXDf_TXTEoPpTA/edit"
                    target="_blank">Slides</a></p>
            <p>Students will be introduced to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html"
                                                     target="_blank">Turtle</a> graphics library in Python. We'll start
                by drawing basic shapes and designs using the <code>goto</code> method. Students will also learn how to
                customize their pen color and shape.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h5 class="mt-0">Lesson 4: Turtle Race Part 1</h5>
            <p>Week 2 Day 2 | <a
                    href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fxQe-OhfXlKWFKfAeVz1-aXHVBsc8HXDf_TXTEoPpTA/edit#slide=id.gc82d571c78_0_120"
                    target="_blank">Slides</a></p>
            <p>This lesson will introduce another way to draw with the <code>turtle</code> library. Then, to help
                students familiarize themselves with the Turtle Graphics library, we will build a game called Turtle
                Race. In Turtle Race, students will animate multiple turtles racing to a finish line, and then display
                the winner. This project will be finished in the next class.
            </p>

            <h5 class="mt-0">Lesson 5: Turtle Race Part 2</h5>
            <p>Week 3 Day 1 | <a
                    href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fxQe-OhfXlKWFKfAeVz1-aXHVBsc8HXDf_TXTEoPpTA/edit#slide=id.gc82d571c78_0_148"
                    target="_blank">Slides</a></p>
            <p>Students will finish the Turtle Race game that they started in the previous lesson.

            <h5 class="mt-0">Final Project: Block Collector</h5>
            <p>Week 3 Day 2 - Week 6 | <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hIgNtLACfnG-aQq7VrQqCePrqS4ieHRUM3r0A4x6F6k/edit" target="_blank">Slides</a> </p>
            <p>Students will create a game called Block Collector. In Block Collector, a player moves a block around
                their screen and tries to collect other blocks to increase their score. Students who want an extra
                challenge can implement additional features, like game restarts, a high score, and a timer. This will be
                the capstone project for the course.
