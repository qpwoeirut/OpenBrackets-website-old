        This course builds on the Beginner Python course and covers Python graphics via a library called Turtle.
        Students will become familiar with how to use the Turtle library and build graphics-based games.
        As a part of this, students will learn about events and event handlers.
        At the end of the course, students will build their own versions of the classic arcade game Snake.
