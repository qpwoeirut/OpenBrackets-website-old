            <br>

            <h5 class="mt-0">Lesson 1: Intro to Python</h5>
            <p>October 12 | <a
                    href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Flq_bK7ECxGIe0OPPMHyZGb7QUOsH7DEjhJNCRegp5A">Slides</a>
            </p>
            <p>Students will learn what a computer programming language is, why learning Python is worthwhile, and touch
                upon basic syntax in Python. Print statements, math operations, variables, and types will all be covered
                in
                this lesson. By the end of Lesson 1, students will be able to print a random number.
            </p>

            <p> Students will learn about if statements, else statements, and elif statements. They will also learn the
                meaning of "and" and "or" in computer logic. By the end of Lesson 2, students will have a completed
                Rock,
                Paper, Scissors game.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h5 class="mt-0">Lesson 3: Loops</h5>
            <p>October 19 | <a

            </p>
            <p> Students will learn about for and while loops and the logic behind both. They will practice using both
                in
                applicable settings, and by the end of Lesson 3, will have a complete Random Number Guessing game that
                they
                can play against the computer.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h5 class="mt-0">Lesson 4: Methods and Classes</h5>
            <p>October 23 | <a
                    href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CdLDwgxxKFU-ESyK6UhldIFXrz-L0rgCKstPv6AGWMM">Slides</a>
            </p>
            <p> Students will learn about the anatomy of methods and classes, and practice writing their own of each.
                They
                will learn what parameters and method calls are, and by the end of Lesson 5, they will have a completed
                MadLib Generator.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h5 class="mt-0">Lesson 5: Lists</h5>
            <p>October 26 | <a
                    href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XI_pfq_w-hzEm3oM2fFoYI7LHkclQy3rvOQB5SvL8uc">Slides</a>
            </p>
            <p> Students will learn about what lists in Python, as well as its applications. To see a real application
                of
                lists, as well as the methods that can be performed on lists, students will practice making grocery
                lists.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h5 class="mt-0">Lesson 6: 2D Lists and Dictionaries</h5>
            <p>October 30 | <a
                    href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13rlfQ1F8OyM8IFx1uuLksoz5l9oyhe_Mxgj-4mi_bkY/edit?usp=sharing">Slides</a>
            </p>
            <p> Students will learn how 2D list and dictionaries can be utilized as Python structures. By the end of
                Lesson
                6,
                they will have a solid foundation in lists, traversing lists, and dictionaries, as well as a house built
                using a dictionary.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h5 class="mt-0">Final Project</h5>
            <p>November 2</p>
            <p> After students have progressed through the first 6 lessons, they will be guided through creating their
                own
                game: <a href="https://repl.it/@AndrewLi27/Treasure-Hunter#main.py">Treasure Hunter</a>. Much like
                battleship, players must find 3 gold nuggets on a 5 by 5 grid before their
                turns are up. This project utilizes a little bit of every lesson, and will allow students to walk away
                with
                a concrete game they created themselves.
