        <h5 class="mt-0">Lesson 1: Intro to Python</h5>
        <p>Students will learn what a computer programming language is, why learning Python is worthwhile, and touch
            upon basic syntax in Python. Print statements, math operations, variables, and types will all be covered in
            this lesson. By the end of Lesson 1, students will be able to print a random number.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h5 class="mt-0">Lesson 2: Conditionals and Logic</h5>
        <p> Students will learn about if statements, else statements, and elif statements. They will also learn the
            meaning of "and" and "or" in computer logic. By the end of Lesson 2, students will have a completed Rock,
            Paper, Scissors game.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h5 class="mt-0">Lesson 3: Loops</h5>
        <p> Students will learn about for and while loops and the logic behind both. They will practice using both in
            applicable settings, and by the end of Lesson 3, will have a complete Random Number Guessing game that they
            can play against the computer.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h5 class="mt-0">Lesson 4: Lists and Dictionaries</h5>
        <p> Students will learn about what lists and dictionaries are in Python, as well as their applications. To
            practice using lists, as well as the methods that can be performed on lists, students will practice making
            grocery lists.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h5 class="mt-0">Lesson 5: Methods and Classes</h5>
        <p> Students will learn about the anatomy of methods and classes, and practice writing their own of each. They
            will learn what parameters and method calls are, and by the end of Lesson 5, they will have a completed
            MadLib Generator.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h5 class="mt-0">Lesson 6: Graphics</h5>
        <p> Students will learn how graphics can enhance a video game, as well as how to use graphics in Python, using
            PyGame. By the end of Lesson 6, they will have a solid graphics foundation, as well as a graphic Rock,
            Paper, Scissors game, and enhanced version of the previously text-based one.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h5 class="mt-0">Final Project</h5>
        <p> After students have progressed through the first 6 lessons, they will be guided through creating their own
            game: Treasure Hunter. Much like battleship, players must find 3 gold nuggets on a 5 by 5 grid before their
            turns are up. This project utilizes a little bit of every lesson, and will allow students to walk away with
            a concrete game they created themselves.
