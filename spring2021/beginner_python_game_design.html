            </p>
            <p>Students will learn what a computer programming language is, why learning Python is worthwhile, and touch
                upon basic syntax in Python. Print statements, math operations, variables, and types will all be covered
                in this lesson. By the end of Lesson 1, students will be able to print a random number.
            </p>

            <p>After students have progressed through the first 6 lessons, they will be guided through creating
                their own game: <a href="https://repl.it/talk/share/Treasure-Hunter/57676" target="_blank">Treasure
                    Hunter</a>.
                In this game, players must find 3 gold nuggets on a 5 by 5 grid before their turns are up.
                This project utilizes a little bit of every lesson, and will allow students to walk away with a concrete
                game they created themselves.
