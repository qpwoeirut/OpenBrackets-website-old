    <h3 class="text-center">Our Mission</h3>
    <p>At OpenBrackets, we want to help bridge the digital divide. Inspired by the Black Lives Matter
        movement in Spring/Summer 2020, we wanted to make immediate change in our community. Through our
        course offerings, we provide support in computer science to middle and high school kids who may not
        receive it at home, and encourage kids all over the Bay to consider tech as a career. We also
        provide students with the opportunity to hear from Guest Speakers in the industry, to see the
        versatility a computer science foundation can provide.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3 class="text-center">Course Offerings</h3>
    <p>
        Last fall we are offered 2 Game Design courses. For grades K-4, we had <b>Game Design Juniors</b>
        which taught students computer science concepts through the block-based language Scratch. For
        grades 5-12, we had <b>Python Game Design</b> which taught students the computer
        programming language of Python through simple games that they created after each lesson. During these
        5 week courses, students learned how to tackle problems presented to them, the basics of Python,
        and walked away with their own final game. You can see a more in-depth description of our lessons
        on the <a href="curriculum.html">curriculum</a> page.

        "<i>All your staff were amazing and worked so well with our children considering the circumstances.
        My son had never done any coding before and not only did he learn so much from this experience
        but enjoyed his time with you all as well.</i>" - Sheryl (Elijah's mom)
