                <h3> Our Mission </h3>

                <p> At OpenBrackets, we want to help bridge the digital divide. Inspired by the Black Lives Matter
                    movement in Spring/Summer 2020, we wanted to make immediate change in our community. Through our
                    course offerings, we provide support in computer science to middle and high school kids who may not
                    receive it at home, and encourage kids all over the Bay to consider tech as a career. We also
                    provide students with the opportunity to hear from Guest Speakers in the industry, to see the
                    versatility a computer science foundation can provide.
                </p>


                <br>
                <h3> Current Offerings </h3>


                <p>
                    This fall we are offering 2 Game Design courses. For grades K-4, we have <b>Game Design Juniors</b>
                    which will teach students computer science concepts through block-based language, Scratch. For
                    grades 5-12, we have <b>Python Game Design</b> which will allow students to learn the computer
                    programming language of Python through simple games that they create after each lesson. During these
                    5 week courses, students will learn how to tackle problems presented to them, the basics of Python,
                    and will walk away with their own final game. You can see a more in-depth description of our lessons
                    on the <a href="curriculum.html">curriculum</a> page.
                </p>

                <h6> We will announce our Spring 2021 course selection in early January 2021, so keep an eye out for
                    that!</h6>
