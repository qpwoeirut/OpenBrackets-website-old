        "<i>I wanted to thank you all for having this class for our children. Though I know that it was
        difficult to navigate remotely, my son was still able to get so much out of it. All your staff were
        amazing and worked so well with our children considering the circumstances. My son had never done any
        coding before and not only did he learn so much from this experience but enjoyed his time with you all
        as well. Thank you again for your guidance and patience and for bringing so much joy to our son.</i>"

        "<i>This was my son's first experience with coding and he has really enjoyed this class. Having this
        opportunity at no cost was amazing and such a nice addition to a school year that is anything but
        normal.</i>"

    <p class="px-4 col-12">
        "<i>Thank you to everyone involved from OpenBrackets in conducting and offering this opportunity to our
        children FREE of charge. If it was not for your team, your program and your generosity, I would have
        never been able to enroll my coding enthusiast daughter in a coding program as they cost a fortune but
        you made it possible for us.</i>"

    <p class="px-4 col-12">
        "<i>Thank you very much for conducting the Python class and giving exposure to kids at a young age. I
        appreciate the sincerity, patience and dedication of the entire team and also your professionalism. I
        wish you all the very best and success in life.</i>"
